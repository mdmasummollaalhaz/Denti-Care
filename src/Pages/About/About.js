          A dental bridge can replace a tooth or several teeth. The fake teeth
          in dental bridges look and function like real teeth. For a bridge, a
          person may see a prosthodontist, a dentist who specializes in
          restoring and replacing missing teeth, or a regular dentist. Either
          way, there are many options for filling a gap in a smile. One option
          is to have a crown â€” a fake bit of tooth attached to a small portion
          of real tooth that the dentist has ground down. When a person has lost
          a tooth or the dentist has had to remove it, however, a crown alone is
          not an option, and a dental bridge may be the best choice.
