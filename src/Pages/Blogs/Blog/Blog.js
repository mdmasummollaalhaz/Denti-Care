              Firebase gives us functionality like analytics, databases,
              messaging and crash reporting so we can move quickly and focus on
              our users. Firebase is built on Google infrastructure and scales
              automatically, for even the largest apps.
              <br />
              It's makes it easier to get your users signed-in without having to
              understand the complexities behind implementing your own
              authentication system.
